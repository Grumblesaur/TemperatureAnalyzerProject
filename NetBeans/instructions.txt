In NetBeans, there is a tab on the right hand pannel labeled "Services".
Under the "Databases" tab you should see a "Java DB" button.
If you right click it you should see an option labled "Create Database".
You can give it any name (mytap, for example) and set the admin as "root".
I left the password blank.
After creation you should see the option "jbdc:derby://localhost:1527/<databse name> in the "Databases" section.
When you click on it, you can "Execute Command" and load the code found in this folder ("databse_load.sql") into the window and then click the "Run SQL" button found at the top of the execute window.
Derby is not as nice as SQL about checking for existing tables, but if you start with a blank database this will work.
Then load the data run tablelocation.sql and then the tablesensors.sql
